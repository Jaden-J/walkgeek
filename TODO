FIXME:
- display sometimes adds some bytes after row/col is set, probably problem is
  with ISR timeouts
- trace via CDC goes insane after some amount of data
- slow opus files LoadFile func
- sd card > 4Gb reported capacity value is truncated to 4 Gb
- limit min audio file size

TODO:
- usb audio
- handle additional cases: no sd card in
- test OGG seeking
- shutdown ADC threshold
- assert/hard fault -> software irq-less DISP + ability to shut down the player
- Centralized IRQ management
- I2S frequency is inaccurate
- sd card double buffering bug -> temp. workaround -> reduce size
- SD card DMA timeouts
- memzero when de-init Player
- Audio DMA Circular Mode
- pause when headset is removed
- when power-on by USB, go to USB mode, do not apply power???
- when detached from USB, shutdown USB
- FreeRTOS Simulator
