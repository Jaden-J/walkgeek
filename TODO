FIXME:
- display sometimes adds some bytes after row/col is set, probably problem is
  with ISR timeouts
- power-on fails if ppp key is prematurely released (even though screen backlight goes on)
- trace via CDC goes insane after some amount of data
- slow opus files LoadFile func

TODO:
- usb audio
- handle additional cases: no sd card in
- test OGG seeking
- shutdown ADC threshold
- assert/hard fault -> software irq-less DISP + ability to shut down the player
- Centralized IRQ management
- I2S frequency is inaccurate
- sd card double buffering bug -> temp. workaround -> reduce size
- SD card DMA timeouts
- memzero when de-init
