Bugs:
~~~~~~~~ Hardware / Drivers
- display manager sometimes lags (hangs? -> adding some bytes after row/col is
  set, probably problem is with ISR timeouts)
- smth totally wrong with disp sometimes -> shifts rows and later hangs all the
  player (observed only in one board of two)
- I2S frequency is inaccurate
- doesn't get back from msc
- sd card double buffering bug -> temp. workaround -> reduce size
- move celt funcs to mem?
- SD card DMA timeouts
- strange voltage drop on 0.2 V when in pause

~~~~~~~~ Software / Algorithms / Sync
- trace via CDC sometimes goes insane
- navigator needs debugging
- navigator "next" is slow on opus files (opus decoder problem?)
- audio status play/pause sometimes hangs
- PAUSE BROKEN
- fadeouts
- sometimes shutdown -> saving can stuck

Features:
- remove pause->stop for audio buffer????
- usb audio
- XXX mem/stack/cpu consumption for celt and MP3?
- handle additional cases: no sd card in
- OGG bisect seeking
- shutdown ADC threshold
- assert/hard fault -> software irq-less DISP
- Deinit USB
- Centralized IRQ management
